    "#In Python, generators are a convenient way to create iterators. They are defined using a function that contains one or more yield statements. When the function is called, it returns a generator object without executing the function body. Each time the next() function is called on the generator object, the function runs until it encounters a yield statement, which pauses the function and saves its state. The generator remembers this state and continues from where it left off when next() is called again.\n",
